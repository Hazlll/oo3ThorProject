Project Title: SmartSaving 
SDG 1: No Poverty
Description: SmartSaving is a program that helps others calculate savings over time and track their daily expenses by simply entering their initial deposit, monthly payment, and interest rate. It then calculates and displays the total savings after the specified number of months. Furthermore, by entering the user's expenses, the program will categorize them and look at their spending habits so that the user can know their daily expenses.

Additional features:

- Allow users to understand their own money management through a virtual piggy bank simulation of the system.

- Display graphs of savings growth over time.

- Generate monthly expense reports and visualize spending patterns.

- Displays the number of denominations in the piggy bank.

- Setting a monthly challenge for users and if they complete it, giving rewards. 
Update Total Savings 

- Allowing users to set their maximum monthly spending limit, which can help keep track of the user's expenses to the maximum limits that they have set.  If the expenses are getting closed. Then the program will give a warning
